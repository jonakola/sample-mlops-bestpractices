## Adding Screenshots

```bash
# Add screenshot to this directory
cp /path/to/screenshot.png docs/screenshots/DirectTestingInSGPlayground-custom-handler.png

# Verify it's referenced correctly
grep -r "DirectTestingInSGPlayground-custom-handler.png" .
```

## Evidently Interactive Reports

**Note**: Notebooks in `2_inference_monitoring.ipynb` contain embedded Evidently HTML reports. These work when running notebooks locally but don't render on GitHub (security limitation). See [evidently/](evidently/) folder for example screenshots.

## Notes

- Use PNG format for better quality
- Ensure text is readable in screenshots
- Blur any sensitive information (account IDs, bucket names)
- Include browser/UI chrome to show context
- Screenshots should match the documented workflow
- For Evidently reports, capture the full interactive UI with multiple tabs visible
